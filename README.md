# NH-Quasiperiodic-Spreading
This repository contains all the source codes and original data for Ze-Yu Xing, Shu Chen and Haiping Hu, 
_Universal Spreading Dynamics in Quasiperiodic Non-Hermitian Systems_,
[arXiv:2412.01301](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.01301).

Later, I'll write a detailed illustration of these codes once I'm available.

## Note
Most of the computation are implemented by functions in `module.jl`, while all the figures are plotted by Mathematica. (Hmm, this sounds quite troublesome. Why not directly generate figures with Julia? In my later works, I'll try to plot with CairoMakie.jl)
